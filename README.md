# Final Project 2015: S-HITMAN
# by: Michal Jez and Shadman Hassan

My Grade 11 Computer Science Final Project. My partner and I created a top down shooter in Python. Super Hitman is a top down shooter 
where the objective is to kill all enemies onscreen per wave. He can move with WASD controls and can use primary and secondary weapons
with mouse buttons. You can scroll to change weapons. There is a gun store to purchase more ammo. Press E to enter
the gun store and press E at the counter to buy ammo, health, gun upgrades and special bullets
such as homing and reflecting bullets. The shop can be entered at any time. The aim of the game is
to survive the longest. Score is accumulated per kill, and text prompts show up for special kills (E.g.as knife,
reflect kills). To exit any part of the game, close the game window. Have fun!
